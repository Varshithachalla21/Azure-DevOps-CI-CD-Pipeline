# Azure-DevOps-CI-CD-Pipeline
We shall look at the pipeline which serves a DevOps practice to deploy Azure Databricks notebooks from a development environment to a production environment. 
CI/CD practices are a integral part of DevOps, enabling organizations to release features to production at scale. 
These practices not only accelerate the deployment process but also address commonchallenges, allowing organizations to overcome constraints effectively. 
In the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), deployment is as crucial as development.
A successful deployment can significantly contribute to an organization's growth.
